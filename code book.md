Title: Code Book for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project Author: Sandeep

Project Description The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. We should submit a tidy data set and The Github repo containing the required scripts. You should also create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Notes on the original data
